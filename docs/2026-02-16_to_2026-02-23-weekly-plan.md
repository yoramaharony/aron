# Weekly Plan — Feb 16 to Feb 23, 2026

**Source:** [Stakeholder review — Feb 16](meetings/2026-02-16-stakeholder-review.md)

**Theme:** Migrate donor detail views to org side, then simplify donor UX

**Strategy:** Migrate-first, then simplify. We invested significant work in the opportunity detail views (stepper, phase-specific cards, materials, meeting outcomes, due diligence checklist, timeline). Rather than discarding them, we migrate these views to the organization/requestor portal first — where detailed progress tracking belongs. Once preserved on the org side, we freely simplify the donor side to Pass / See More / Pledge.

**Key design principles (clarified Feb 17):**
1. **Donor does minimum work.** No manual meeting notes — AI bot joins Zoom and captures notes automatically. No manual due diligence checkboxes.
2. **Meeting scheduling is collaborative.** Donor's concierge proposes a meeting → org must **Accept**, **Reschedule**, or **Propose alternative time**. Keep this interaction on the org side.
3. **Each stage advancement adds concierge-generated detail.** When advancing via the stepper hack (or in production via concierge), each stage should inject realistic data as if the concierge filled it in (e.g., advancing to "meeting" adds meeting details, advancing to "review" adds AI meeting summary and due diligence findings, advancing to "decision" adds a recommendation note).

**Goal for next meeting:** Demo the full opportunity lifecycle from the organization's perspective (with concierge-advance hack on stepper dots), plus a streamlined donor experience with simple actions and opportunity browsing.

## Phase A — Migrate Detail Views to Organization Side (Mon–Wed)

This is the foundation. We preserve our work and give the org side the detailed tracking it needs.

### A1. Organization request detail page

Create a detail page for each submission that reuses the components we built for the donor side, but from the org's perspective (read-only where the donor had actions).

**Reuse from donor side → org equivalent:**

| Donor component | Org migration | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `OpportunityStepper` | Same component, org-facing labels | Submitted → Info Requested → Meeting → Review → Decision |
| Meeting scheduling | Accept / Reschedule / Propose | Org responds to concierge's proposed meeting time |
| Meeting Outcomes card | Read-only (AI-generated) | AI bot captures meeting notes — org sees summary, tone, follow-ups |
| Materials section (3 sections) | Same layout | Org docs they submitted + meeting docs (read-only) |
| Due diligence checklist | Progress indicator | Org sees which checks are done (read-only) |
| Timeline / History | Same component, org perspective | "Donor requested more info" instead of "You requested more info" |
| Notes section | Not migrated | Donor notes are private |

**Tasks:**
- [x] Create `/requestor/requests/[id]` detail page
- [x] Reuse `OpportunityStepper` with org-friendly stage labels
- [x] Show request summary, amount, category, location (from their submission)
- [x] Show info request status: pending / responded (link to existing `/more-info/[token]` flow)
- [x] Meeting scheduling interaction: org sees proposed time → **Accept** / **Reschedule** / **Propose New Time**
- [x] Show meeting outcomes (AI-generated notes) — read-only card with summary, tone, follow-ups
- [x] Show materials section (org docs they uploaded, meeting docs from donor side)
- [x] Show due diligence progress as a read-only status (not checkboxes)
- [x] Show event timeline from org perspective

### A2. Stepper dot "concierge advance" hack (demo only)

For the demo, clicking a stepper dot simulates the concierge progressing the request to that stage. This lets us walk through the full lifecycle from the org's view without needing real donor actions.

**Tasks:**
- [x] Add click handler on stepper dots (org side only) that calls the existing actions API to advance stage
- [x] Visual confirmation (brief flash/toast) when a stage is advanced
- [x] Support advancing to: info_requested, scheduled, meeting_completed, diligence_completed, funded
- [x] Guard: only allow advancing forward, not backward
- [x] Small "demo" badge or subtle indicator so it's clear this is a demo shortcut
- [x] **Each advance injects concierge-generated detail into the opportunity:**

| Stage advanced to | Data injected |
| --- | --- |
| `info_requested` | Concierge note: "Additional documentation requested — financial statements and board resolution" |
| `scheduled` | Meeting details: type (Zoom), proposed date/time, concierge name, agenda notes |
| `meeting_completed` | AI meeting summary: tone, key takeaways, amount confirmation, follow-up items (as if bot captured) |
| `diligence_completed` | Due diligence findings: checklist results, concierge assessment, risk notes |
| `funded` | Decision note: "Approved by concierge. Commitment confirmed." + pledge amount |

### A3. Enhance `/requestor/requests` list page

**Tasks:**
- [x] Show mini stepper or status badge on each request card in the list
- [x] Click a request → navigate to detail page (A1)
- [x] Show key stats: amount, date submitted, current stage

---

## Phase B — Simplify Donor Side (Wed–Thu)

Now that detail views are preserved on the org side, strip the donor view down.

### B1. Simplify to three primary actions: Pass, See More, Pledge

**Tasks:**
- [x] Replace multi-button workflow with: **Pass** (outline) | **See More** (outline/gold) | **Pledge** (solid/gold)
- [x] "Pass" → moves to Passed tab + auto-advances to next opportunity
- [x] "See More" → expands full details (overview, financials, org info, materials) — single toggle, no phases
- [x] "Pledge" → directly commits (existing Approve & Pledge logic), available at any stage
- [x] Remove intermediate action buttons (Schedule Meeting, Mark Meeting Complete, Complete Due Diligence, Request Info)
- [x] Remove `OpportunityStepper` from donor detail panel
- [x] Keep status as a simple one-line contextual message
- [x] Keep timeline/history as a collapsible secondary section

### B2. Add next/prev navigation for opportunity browsing

**Tasks:**
- [x] Add left/right arrow buttons to navigate between opportunities in the current tab
- [x] Show position indicator (e.g., "3 of 12")
- [x] Keyboard shortcuts: arrow keys or j/k
- [x] Auto-advance to next opportunity after Pass

### B3. Clean up removed donor features

**Tasks:**
- [x] Remove meeting scheduling modal from donor flow (concierge handles scheduling; org accepts/reschedules)
- [x] Remove post-meeting summary modal from donor flow (AI bot captures meeting notes)
- [x] Remove due diligence checklist from donor view (concierge handles diligence)
- [x] Keep the overview mode content (cause, amount, geo, urgency, overview, financials, org info) as the "See More" expanded view
- [x] Show AI-generated meeting summary as read-only card when available (populated by concierge advance or AI bot)
- [x] Show concierge notes/findings as read-only timeline entries (donor sees what concierge added at each stage)

---

## Phase C — Demo Data & Polish (Thu–Fri)

### C1. Populate varied demo opportunities

**Tasks:**
- [x] Expand seed data: opportunities across budget ranges ($5K, $25K, $100K, $500K+)
- [x] Diverse impact categories (education/chinuch, healthcare/bikur cholim, emergency, infrastructure, community/chesed)
- [x] Mix of curated Charidy opportunities and direct submissions

### C2. Polish org view for demo

**Tasks:**
- [x] Ensure org view has same dark theme / gold accent polish as donor side
- [x] Test the stepper-advance hack end-to-end: submit as org → advance via dots → see status update
- [x] Ensure info request flow works: donor triggers → org receives → org responds → status updates

## Out of Scope This Week

| Item | Owner | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| AI meeting bot | Shay Chervinsky | We add stub/placeholder; Shay builds the actual bot |
| Define paid due diligence value | Yehuda Gurwitz | Product decision |
| Phase 2 impact features | Future | Pooling, matching, collaborative giving |
| Leverage engine changes | Future | Current implementation stays as-is |
| Payment processing | Future | Manage Payments modal is demo-only |

## Definition of Done (for next meeting demo)

**Org side:**
- [x] Organization can see their submission with a progress stepper (Submitted → Info Requested → Meeting → Review → Decision)
- [x] Clicking stepper dots advances the stage (demo concierge hack)
- [x] Org detail page shows: summary, materials, meeting outcomes (read-only), due diligence status, timeline
- [x] Request list shows status badges for each submission

**Donor side:**
- [x] Donor opens an opportunity and sees **Pass / See More / Pledge** — no stepper, no manual forms
- [x] Donor can browse opportunities with next/prev navigation
- [x] Passing auto-advances to the next opportunity
- [x] Full details accessible via "See More" but not forced
- [x] Timeline/history available but secondary

**Data & continuity:**
- [x] Demo seeded with 10+ varied opportunities across budgets and categories
- [x] All existing functionality still works (pledges, leverage, submission links, receipts, export)
- [x] DB schema and internal workflow state unchanged — only UI changes
